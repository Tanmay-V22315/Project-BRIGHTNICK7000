# Project-BRIGHTNICK7000
This is a Mozilla-TTS and Deepspeech based 'Home assistant' as a part of a school project.

The entire project is made in python. It is a collaboration between Tanmay Vemuri and S.A Rajkumar. Expect to see the relevant docs and logs soon as this is a work in progress.
Currently works only in linux and is not meant to be shipped out. Will work on that probably.

To-Dos:
Using Deepspeech for user input (kind of the whole point of the project).
Saving Queries To a log file
Integrating penetration testing and hacking tools that can be used with speech aliases.
Offline Wikipedia search using wikimedia dumps,
Extensive reply library. (you (the viewer) can  can contribute to this library as well once we get around to using a specific file to get replies from.)
Config.json integration to carry forward variables specified by end-user.
Opening applications.
Sending input via voice.
