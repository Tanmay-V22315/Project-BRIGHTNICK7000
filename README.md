# Project-BRIGHTNICK7000
## This is a Mozilla-TTS and Deepspeech/SpeechRecognition based 'Home assistant' as a part of I.P./C.S. school project for Class 12 (K.D.A.V.)

The entire project is made in python. It is a collaboration between Tanmay Vemuri and S.A Rajkumar. Expect to see the relevant docs and logs soon as this is a work in progress.
Currently works only in linux and is not meant to be shipped out. Will work on that probably.

Anyone can use anything within this project with absolutely no restrictions. This project is and will always remain open-source.

Have a complaint, suggestion or a copyright complaint? Contact us at Tanmay.vemuri85@gmail.com or rajkumar743591@gmail.com (These email addresses will probably be changed or removed later so keep your eye out on that).

This entire project is motivated by the principle that if you're going to make something stupid, you might as well go all in, so there'll definitely be traces of that in this project.

### To-Dos:
-Using Deepspeech or Speech_recognition for user input (kind of the whole point of the project).
<br>
-Saving Queries To a log file
<br>
-Integrating penetration testing and hacking tools that can be used with speech aliases.
<br>
-Offline Wikipedia search using wikimedia dumps,
<br>
-Extensive reply library. (you (the viewer) can contribute to this library as well once we get around to using a specific file to get replies from.)
<br>
-Config.json integration to carry forward variables specified by end-user.
<br>
-Opening applications.
<br>
-Voice recognition. (Unlikely, but will try if time permits)
