# Project-BRIGHTNICK7000
## This is a Mozilla-TTS and Deepspeech/SpeechRecognition based 'Home assistant' as a part of I.P./C.S. school project for Class 12 (K.D.A.V.)

The entire project is made in python. Made by Tanmay Vemuri. Expect to see the relevant docs and logs soon as this is a work in progress.
Currently works only in linux and is not meant to be shipped out. Will work on that probably.

Current state of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY1tT1fTJ2Q

Anyone can use anything within this project with absolutely no restrictions. This project is and will always remain open-source.

Have a complaint, suggestion or a copyright complaint? Contact us at Tanmay.vemuri85@gmail.com (This email address will probably be changed or removed later so keep your eye out on that).

This entire project is motivated by the principle that if you're going to make something stupid, you might as well go all in, so there'll definitely be traces of that in this project.

Target platform is a raspberry pi but this may change based on the performance. We have noticed that installing mozilla tts is a bit different and harder on a raspberry pi, not to mention that the raspberry pi has very constrained hardware so we'll have to see how this goes along.

### To-Dos:
-Using Deepspeech or Speech_recognition for user input (kind of the whole point of the project).
<br>
-Saving Queries To a log file
<br>
-Integrating penetration testing and hacking tools that can be used with speech aliases.
<br>
-Offline Wikipedia search using wikimedia dumps,
<br>
-Extensive reply library. (you (the viewer) can contribute to this library as well once we get around to using a specific file to get replies from.)
<br>
-Config.json integration to carry forward variables specified by end-user.
<br>
-Opening applications.
<br>
-Voice recognition. (Unlikely, but will try if time permits)
