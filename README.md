# Project-BRIGHTNICK7000
This is a Mozilla-TTS and Deepspeech based 'Home assistant' as a part of a school project.

The entire project is made in python. It is a collaboration between Tanmay Vemuri and S.A Rajkumar. Expect to see the relevant docs and logs soon as this is a work in progress.
Currently works only in linux and is not meant to be shipped out. Will work on them, probably.
